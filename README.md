# neo
A modern (C++20) C++ standard library.

# What is neo?
**neo** is an implementation of a C++ standard library, leveraging all the new features introduced to the language in the latest standards.

# Why neo?
After using [SerenityOS's AK](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/tree/master/AK) (the standard library used for development of [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity)
I realized how cluttered and bloated the STL was(and is). STL needs to keep backwards compatibility with old c++ standards not to break ABI as many programs depend on it. But that's not for me.
I want to use a modern library that doesn't fall behind or is against breaking change on the excuse of backwards compatibility.
